# EM-Gaussian-Mixture

A program implemented in MATLAB for clustering of bivariate data (eruption duration time and waiting time between) obtained from the ‘Old Faithful’ geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. The model utilized two 2-dimensional gaussians, which were fitted to the dataset via the expectation-maximization algorithm. The matlab code relies on having the 'old_faithful.dat' file in the same directory.
